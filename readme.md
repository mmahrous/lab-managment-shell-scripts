## Lab Managment shell scripts
This scripts I created cause I had to deal with 24 PC in the same LAN.

The first script used to authorize the ssh key of the managment machine
```
sh sshkey_authorize.sh
```
you can edit **HOSTS** with your PCs ip address
*I consider that you know your ip address of the machines*
